# Welcome to Prism Project
Thank you for exploring Prism! This project was created for educational purposes to deepen our understanding of programming languages and concepts such as AST, Compilers, Virtual Machines and more. While we are not accepting external contributions, we encourage you to review and experiment with the code to support your own learning journey.

## Feedback and Questions
If you encounter technical inconsistencies, unexpected behavior, or have questions about the implementation, feel free to contact me directly.
I welcome curiosity-driven conversations!
